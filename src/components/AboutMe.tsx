          Building software that stands the test of time and scales effortlessly? That's my sweet spot. I learned the value of maintainable code early on, and that lesson still shapes how I approach every project. While I'm comfortable across the full stack, my passion lies in the backend, where <span className="text-highlight-yellow">Rust</span> and <span className="text-highlight-yellow">Python</span> are my go-to tools for crafting robust solutions. I'm always eager to dive into new technologies that solve complex problems with elegance.

        <p>
          Beyond the code, I'm energized by the world of entrepreneurship. I'm actively exploring startup ideas and using my technical skills to build innovative solutions. This dual perspective helps me connect technical execution with strategic vision.

          Collaboration is key in my book. I thrive in team environments and bring a strong foundation in research and problem-solving to the table. I'm known for digging deep to find thoughtful answers to challenging puzzles.

          On a personal note, family is my priority. Being a husband and parent shapes my perspective and reminds me what truly matters.
